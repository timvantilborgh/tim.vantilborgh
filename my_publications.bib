We tested these direct and reverse relationships by means of structural equation modeling using latent growth parameters on weekly survey data from 80 respondents for 10 consecutive weeks (516 observations). Our results revealed that an accumulation of PC breach over the course of 10weeks was positively associated with intensifying violation feelings, which in turn was positively associated with the enactment of an increasing number of CWB-O acts over time. However, we did not find such a relationship for the enactment of OCB-O acts over time. Moreover, we found that both static and increasing numbers of OCB-O and CWB-O acts were negatively and positively related to static and accumulating perceptions of PC breach, respectively. This study challenges the static treatment of PC breach and its reactions, as well as the often assumed negative PC breach-OCB-O relationship. In addition, this study demonstrates a recursive relationship between PC breach and OCB-O and CWB-O.},

This special issue showcases how a temporal process‐oriented lens can be used to study dynamics of workplace phenomena. In this editorial, we define the term dynamics, arguing that research on workplace dynamics focuses on how within‐person (or more broadly, within‐unit) processes unfold over time. Moreover, we zoom in on the diverse roles of time, illustrating the rich diversity in research on workplace dynamics, and we highlight three specific challenges for scholars wanting to pursue this line of research. We conclude that the time has come to move from a differential to a temporal and process‐oriented perspective, allowing us to understand what happens, how things happen, and why things happen at the workplace.},

We review fundamentals of the methodology and argue how it addresses some of the limitations of the traditional approaches to modeling repeated measures data. The usefulness of k-centres FC is demonstrated by applying the method to weekly measured commitment data from 109 participants who reported psychological contract breach events. The k-centres FC analysis shows two substantively meaningful clusters, the first cluster showing reaction patterns with general growth in commitment after breach and the second cluster showing general decline in commitment after breach. Further, the reaction patterns in the second cluster appear to be the result of a combination of two interesting reaction logics: immediate and delayed reactions. We conclude by outlining how future organizational research can incorporate this methodology.},

As feelings of intrinsic motivation stimulate volunteer well-being and their long-term engagement, we study how team inclusion relates to volunteers’ intrinsic motivation during their activities. We hypothesize that volunteers’ perceptions of inclusion are positively related to intrinsic motivation, via the satisfaction of their basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a daily-diary study, obtaining a final sample of 43 volunteers and 204 completed diaries. Multilevel path analyses showed that team inclusion was positively related to volunteers’ intrinsic motivation during their activities. Subsequent mediation analyses revealed that competence and relatedness need satisfaction mediated this relationship. Thus, when volunteers feel part of the team with which they complete their activities, they experience intrinsic motivation because feeling included stimulates their feelings of being competent and being related to others.},

	abstract = {Previous research showed that perceptions of psychological contract (PC) breach have undesirable individual and organizational consequences. Surprisingly, the PC literature has paid little to no attention to the relationship between PC breach perceptions and stress. A better understanding of how PC breach may elicit stress seems crucial, given that stress plays a key role in employees’ physical and mental well-being. Based on Conservation of Resources Theory, we suggest that PC breach perceptions represent a perceived loss of valued resources, subsequently leading employees to experience higher stress levels resulting from emerging negative emotions. Moreover, we suggest that this mediated relationship is moderated by initial levels of fatigue, due to fatigue lowering the personal resources necessary to cope with breach events. To tests our hypotheses, we analyzed the multilevel data we obtained from two experience sampling designs (Study 1: 51 Belgian employees; Study 2: 53 US employees). Note that the unit of analysis is “observations” rather than “respondents,” resulting in an effective sample size of 730 (Study 1) and 374 (Study 2) observations. In both studies, we found evidence for the mediating role of negative emotions in the PC breach—stress relationship. In the second study, we also found evidence for the moderating role of fatigue in the mediated PC breach—stress relationship. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in applying the psychological contract concept to the relationship between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. However, previous studies overlook certain elements of volunteers’ psychological contracts as they build on theory established with reference to paid employees. We argue that the inclusion of a value-based psychological contract type, next to transactional and relational types, enables a more thorough understanding of perceived mutual obligations between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. We use the critical incidents technique to map volunteers’ perceived (un)fulfilled obligations and find that volunteers perceive both fulfilled and unfulfilled value-based obligations. Moreover, we describe specific terms related to the mission and values of the organization reported by volunteers. We conclude that future psychological contract research needs to take this valuebased dimension into account, especially in volunteerism.},

While this creates challenges for NPO governance and management, little is known about the process or the outcomes of these two developments. We propose a two-dimensional conceptual model to explain how the aforementioned evolutions inﬂuence the attitudes and behavior of volunteers, based on psychological contract theory. More speciﬁcally, we posit that both evolutions create tensions in volunteers’ psychological contracts that could lead to contract breach. We formulate twelve propositions on the nature of this psychological contract breach and the resulting attitudes and behavior of volunteers. Finally, we offer some possible solutions that NPO boards and managers can apply to cope with these challenges.},

I examine if fulﬁllment explains exit, (aggressive and considerate) voice, loyalty, and neglect behaviors of volunteers. Moreover, I test whether these relationships are mediated by violation and trust. Data were collected from 215 volunteers using an online survey and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that fulﬁllment related negatively to exit, aggressive voice, and neglect behavior and positively to considerate voice behavior. Mediation analyses conﬁrmed that violation and trust acted as mediators. I conclude that fulﬁllment is critical to understand why volunteers display exit, (aggressive and considerate) voice, and neglect behavior. Moreover, I propose that violation and trust are able to explain how fulﬁllment is related to these behaviors, through a ‘‘hot’’ and ‘‘cool’’ response system, respectively.},

Analyses are based on 573 effect sizes across 137 longitudinal studies containing unit-level change in job attitudes across three time periods (pre-change, during change, and post-change). Results reveal that unit-level job attitudes (a) decline during cost-oriented changes (e.g., restructuring) and remain at lower levels following the changes (supporting a sustained change model); (b) increase during people-oriented changes (i.e., HRM investments) and remain at higher levels following the interventions (consistent with a sustained change model); and (c) remain unchanged over time when cost- and people-oriented interventions are combined. Tests of a process model further reveal that cost-oriented (people-oriented) interventions impact unit-level job attitudes by reducing (increasing) perceived support (relative to a no intervention control). The pattern of findings suggests that long-term, unit-level change in job attitudes can be anticipated to follow from strategic interventions, although some of the negative impact of cost cutting can be mitigated by maintaining perceptions of support.},

Data from 20 Belgian and 21 Chinese employees were collected using qualitative methods. An analysis of 94 critical incidents relayed by the employees reveals the attributional, emotional, and behavioral reactions that are triggered by psychological contract under-, exact-, and over-fulfillment. Our findings suggest that supervisors were seen as directly responsible for most of the employees’ psychological contract evaluations. Emotional responses are more complex in the process of attributing responsibility. Behavioral actions are subsequently used to deal with three types of psychological contract evaluations. A number of subtle differences are found between the Belgian and Chinese employees. The results highlight the unfolding and dynamic nature of the psychological contract in cultural comparisons.},

	abstract = {Ideological psychological contracts (PC) describe perceived obligations that relate to an organization’s mission, values, and principles, and they relate closely to employees’ selfconcept. The ideological currency is prevalent across various professions and organizations. In this study, we argue that employees engage in corrective behavior (i.e., pro-social rule breaking; PSRB) in response to large discrepancies between obligated and delivered ideological inducements (i.e., ideological PC breach). We measure breach obligated and delivered ideological inducements separately to examine their different effects on PSRB. Based on prior theoretical models, we examine core self-evaluation (i.e., CSE) and include perceptions of ideological PC breach and fulfillment as antecedents of PSRB, as well as the role of CSE in the relationship between perceptions of ideological PC breach and fulfillment and PSRB. Our results suggest that PSRB negatively relates to both the breach and fulfillment continua, and delivered ideological inducements relates more strongly to PSRB than obligated ideological inducements. Moreover, CSE does not moderate the relationship between ideological PC breach and fulfillment and PSRB. These results further our understanding of how ideological PCs shape employees’ behavior. By examining the moderating role of CSE, we advance the PC literature by showing that ideological PC breach and fulfillment perceptions are better antecedents of PSRB than CSE.},
