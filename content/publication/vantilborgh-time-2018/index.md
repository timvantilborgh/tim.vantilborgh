abstract: Most, if not all, workplace phenomena are dynamic, meaning that they emerge,
  evolve, and dissolve over time. Yet, the role of time is commonly overlooked in
  OB literature. This special issue showcases how a temporal process‐oriented lens
  can be used to study dynamics of workplace phenomena. In this editorial, we define
  the term dynamics, arguing that research on workplace dynamics focuses on how within‐person
  (or more broadly, within‐unit) processes unfold over time. Moreover, we zoom in
  on the diverse roles of time, illustrating the rich diversity in research on workplace
  dynamics, and we highlight three specific challenges for scholars wanting to pursue
  this line of research. We conclude that the time has come to move from a differential
  to a temporal and process‐oriented perspective, allowing us to understand what happens,
  how things happen, and why things happen at the workplace.
