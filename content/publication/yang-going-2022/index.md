abstract: Ideological psychological contracts (PC) describe perceived obligations
  that relate to an organization’s mission, values, and principles, and they relate
  closely to employees’ selfconcept. The ideological currency is prevalent across
  various professions and organizations. In this study, we argue that employees engage
  in corrective behavior (i.e., pro-social rule breaking; PSRB) in response to large
  discrepancies between obligated and delivered ideological inducements (i.e., ideological
  PC breach). We measure breach obligated and delivered ideological inducements separately
  to examine their different effects on PSRB. Based on prior theoretical models, we
  examine core self-evaluation (i.e., CSE) and include perceptions of ideological
  PC breach and fulfillment as antecedents of PSRB, as well as the role of CSE in
  the relationship between perceptions of ideological PC breach and fulfillment and
  PSRB. Our results suggest that PSRB negatively relates to both the breach and fulfillment
  continua, and delivered ideological inducements relates more strongly to PSRB than
  obligated ideological inducements. Moreover, CSE does not moderate the relationship
  between ideological PC breach and fulfillment and PSRB. These results further our
  understanding of how ideological PCs shape employees’ behavior. By examining the
  moderating role of CSE, we advance the PC literature by showing that ideological
  PC breach and fulfillment perceptions are better antecedents of PSRB than CSE.
