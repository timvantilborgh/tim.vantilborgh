abstract: Psychological contract fulﬁllment—an individual’s perception of the degree
  to which an organization fulﬁlls its promises—is critical to understand how people
  behave in exchange relationships. I examine if fulﬁllment explains exit, (aggressive
  and considerate) voice, loyalty, and neglect behaviors of volunteers. Moreover,
  I test whether these relationships are mediated by violation and trust. Data were
  collected from 215 volunteers using an online survey and analyzed using structural
  equation modeling. Results indicated that fulﬁllment related negatively to exit,
  aggressive voice, and neglect behavior and positively to considerate voice behavior.
  Mediation analyses conﬁrmed that violation and trust acted as mediators. I conclude
  that fulﬁllment is critical to understand why volunteers display exit, (aggressive
  and considerate) voice, and neglect behavior. Moreover, I propose that violation
  and trust are able to explain how fulﬁllment is related to these behaviors, through
  a ‘‘hot’’ and ‘‘cool’’ response system, respectively.
