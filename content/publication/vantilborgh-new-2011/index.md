abstract: Two major evolutions have been reported to occur in the nonproﬁt sector
  during the past decades. Both the nature of nonproﬁt organizations (NPOs) and of
  volunteering style are changing. While this creates challenges for NPO governance
  and management, little is known about the process or the outcomes of these two developments.
  We propose a two-dimensional conceptual model to explain how the aforementioned
  evolutions inﬂuence the attitudes and behavior of volunteers, based on psychological
  contract theory. More speciﬁcally, we posit that both evolutions create tensions
  in volunteers’ psychological contracts that could lead to contract breach. We formulate
  twelve propositions on the nature of this psychological contract breach and the
  resulting attitudes and behavior of volunteers. Finally, we offer some possible
  solutions that NPO boards and managers can apply to cope with these challenges.
