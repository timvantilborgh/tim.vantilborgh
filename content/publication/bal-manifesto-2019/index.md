abstract: This manifesto presents 10 recommendations for a sustainable future for
  the ﬁeld of Work and Organizational Psychology. The manifesto is the result of an
  emerging movement around the Future of WOP (see www. futureofwop.com), which aims
  to bring together WOP-scholars committed to actively contribute to building a better
  future for our ﬁeld. Our recommendations are intended to support both individuals
  and collectives to become actively engaged in co-creating the future of WOP together
  with us. Therefore, this manifesto is open and never “ﬁnished.” It should continuously
  evolve, based on an ongoing debate around our professional values and behavior.
  This manifesto is meant, ﬁrst of all, for ourselves as an academic community. Furthermore,
  it is also important for managers, decision makers, and other stakeholders and interested
  parties, such as students, governments and organizations, as we envision what the
  future of WOP could look like, and it is only through our collective eﬀorts that
  we will be able to realize a sustainable future for all of us.
