abstract: A nonproﬁt “governance quality index” was developed to enable veriﬁcation
  and falsiﬁcation of contemporary theoretical insights on social service organizations.
  Indicators were generated based on an extensive qualitative exploration. For the
  quantitative validation, a data set was composed of 526 respondents from 52 organizations.
  Five subdimensions of governance quality are introduced and are recommended to be
  used as separate scales, rather than combined into a single score on governance
  quality. Furthermore, the recommendation is made to rely on multiple raters per
  organization to assess governance quality or related concepts, given the substantial
  within-organization variance found.
