abstract: The reliability of volunteers is a major concern for many nonproﬁt organizations.
  To address this problem in more detail, we develop a theoretical model of volunteer
  reliability based on psychological contract theory. By taking this perspective as
  a starting point, we explore how individual volunteer characteristics, organizational
  factors, and sociological developments shape the exchange of inducements and contributions
  between volunteers and nonproﬁt organizations. We discuss how these factors can
  create tensions in the psychological contract and determine the extent to which
  volunteers behave reliably. As such, we develop a theoretical framework for addressing
  the reliability problem in volunteer management.
