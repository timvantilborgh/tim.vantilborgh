abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamic relationship between
  psychological contract (PC) breach, violation feelings, and acts of counterproductive
  work (CWBs) and organizational citizenship (OCBs) behavior, as well as to investigate
  the reverse relationship from CWB and OCB to PC breach. We tested these direct and
  reverse relationships by means of structural equation modeling using latent growth
  parameters on weekly survey data from 80 respondents for 10 consecutive weeks (516
  observations). Our results revealed that an accumulation of PC breach over the course
  of 10weeks was positively associated with intensifying violation feelings, which
  in turn was positively associated with the enactment of an increasing number of
  CWB-O acts over time. However, we did not find such a relationship for the enactment
  of OCB-O acts over time. Moreover, we found that both static and increasing numbers
  of OCB-O and CWB-O acts were negatively and positively related to static and accumulating
  perceptions of PC breach, respectively. This study challenges the static treatment
  of PC breach and its reactions, as well as the often assumed negative PC breach-OCB-O
  relationship. In addition, this study demonstrates a recursive relationship between
  PC breach and OCB-O and CWB-O.
