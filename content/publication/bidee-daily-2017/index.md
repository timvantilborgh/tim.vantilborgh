abstract: The work of volunteers is indispensable for the well functioning of healthcare
  organizations, and for maintaining the quality of care in times of austerity. As
  feelings of intrinsic motivation stimulate volunteer well-being and their long-term
  engagement, we study how team inclusion relates to volunteers’ intrinsic motivation
  during their activities. We hypothesize that volunteers’ perceptions of inclusion
  are positively related to intrinsic motivation, via the satisfaction of their basic
  needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. To test our hypothesis, we conducted
  a daily-diary study, obtaining a final sample of 43 volunteers and 204 completed
  diaries. Multilevel path analyses showed that team inclusion was positively related
  to volunteers’ intrinsic motivation during their activities. Subsequent mediation
  analyses revealed that competence and relatedness need satisfaction mediated this
  relationship. Thus, when volunteers feel part of the team with which they complete
  their activities, they experience intrinsic motivation because feeling included
  stimulates their feelings of being competent and being related to others.
