abstract: 'In the present paper, we introduce k-centres functional clustering (k-centres
  FC), a person-centered method that clusters people with similar patterns of complex,
  highly nonlinear change over time. We review fundamentals of the methodology and
  argue how it addresses some of the limitations of the traditional approaches to
  modeling repeated measures data. The usefulness of k-centres FC is demonstrated
  by applying the method to weekly measured commitment data from 109 participants
  who reported psychological contract breach events. The k-centres FC analysis shows
  two substantively meaningful clusters, the first cluster showing reaction patterns
  with general growth in commitment after breach and the second cluster showing general
  decline in commitment after breach. Further, the reaction patterns in the second
  cluster appear to be the result of a combination of two interesting reaction logics:
  immediate and delayed reactions. We conclude by outlining how future organizational
  research can incorporate this methodology.'
