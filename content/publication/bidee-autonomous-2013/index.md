abstract: Although today’s nonproﬁt organizations make a strong appeal to volunteers,
  they often have difﬁculties with attracting and retaining these free labor forces.
  In this sense, studying the motivation of volunteers and its effects proves useful.
  In the present article, we investigate the relationship between volunteers’ motivation
  and their self-reported work effort, while relying on the Self-Determination Theory.
  The results indicate a positive link between volunteers’ autonomous motivation and
  work effort. Moreover, this relationship holds for each person in our sample, irrespective
  of the organization in which she/he is volunteering. Implications for future research,
  as well as the practical impact of these ﬁndings, are discussed.
