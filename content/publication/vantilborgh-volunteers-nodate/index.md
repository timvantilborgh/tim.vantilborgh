abstract: There is a growing interest in applying the psychological contract concept
  to the relationship between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. However, previous
  studies overlook certain elements of volunteers’ psychological contracts as they
  build on theory established with reference to paid employees. We argue that the
  inclusion of a value-based psychological contract type, next to transactional and
  relational types, enables a more thorough understanding of perceived mutual obligations
  between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. We use the critical incidents technique
  to map volunteers’ perceived (un)fulfilled obligations and find that volunteers
  perceive both fulfilled and unfulfilled value-based obligations. Moreover, we describe
  specific terms related to the mission and values of the organization reported by
  volunteers. We conclude that future psychological contract research needs to take
  this valuebased dimension into account, especially in volunteerism.
