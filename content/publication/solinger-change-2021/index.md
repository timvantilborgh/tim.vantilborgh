abstract: The present meta-analysis tests how cost- and people-oriented strategic
  interventions impact temporal-dynamic changes in unit-level job attitudes within
  organizations. Analyses are based on 573 effect sizes across 137 longitudinal studies
  containing unit-level change in job attitudes across three time periods (pre-change,
  during change, and post-change). Results reveal that unit-level job attitudes (a)
  decline during cost-oriented changes (e.g., restructuring) and remain at lower levels
  following the changes (supporting a sustained change model); (b) increase during
  people-oriented changes (i.e., HRM investments) and remain at higher levels following
  the interventions (consistent with a sustained change model); and (c) remain unchanged
  over time when cost- and people-oriented interventions are combined. Tests of a
  process model further reveal that cost-oriented (people-oriented) interventions
  impact unit-level job attitudes by reducing (increasing) perceived support (relative
  to a no intervention control). The pattern of findings suggests that long-term,
  unit-level change in job attitudes can be anticipated to follow from strategic interventions,
  although some of the negative impact of cost cutting can be mitigated by maintaining
  perceptions of support.
