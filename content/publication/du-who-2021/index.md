abstract: This study explores cultural differences in the sensemaking process of employees
  following psychological contract evaluations. Data from 20 Belgian and 21 Chinese
  employees were collected using qualitative methods. An analysis of 94 critical incidents
  relayed by the employees reveals the attributional, emotional, and behavioral reactions
  that are triggered by psychological contract under-, exact-, and over-fulfillment.
  Our findings suggest that supervisors were seen as directly responsible for most
  of the employees’ psychological contract evaluations. Emotional responses are more
  complex in the process of attributing responsibility. Behavioral actions are subsequently
  used to deal with three types of psychological contract evaluations. A number of
  subtle differences are found between the Belgian and Chinese employees. The results
  highlight the unfolding and dynamic nature of the psychological contract in cultural
  comparisons.
